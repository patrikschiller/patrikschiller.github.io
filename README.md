## About me

I am 23 years old student living in Prague, Czech Republic. Currently I am studying master's degree in Computer graphics at the Czech Technical University (CTU), Faculty of Electrical Engineering. In 2020 I successfully finished bachelor's degree in Software engineering at CTU FEE.

I am interested in IT, computer graphics, programming, drawing and architecture. Drawing is my hobby since my childhood, especially drawing of architecture and landscapes. Recently (since Q2 2019) I focuse on CG programming (OpenGL & C++, WebGL & JavaScript), 3D assets development (Autodesk Maya) and light game dev (Unity, Unreal Engine*).

Since May 2018 I work for Conquest Entertainment as programmer and e-shop maintainer. In 2020 (July) I started working for CZM at CTU as PHP programmer.

In future I would like to study illumination algorithms and other CG low-level principles. I would like to try DirectX programming (in contrast to OpenGL) and improve my knowledge of C++ / C#.
